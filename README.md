# Astrolab

Astrolab is an Astro integration that brings an isolated UI development tool into your Astro environment. Astrolab brings all your repository components into one place where you can view and modify your props and slots on the fly.

### Compatibility

- ✅ Astro 5.x and up
- ✅ SSG and SSR projects (Astrolab only runs in development so we won't interfere with your deployment approach)
